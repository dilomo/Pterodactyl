## Purpose

Pterodactyl is an open-source plug-in for Grasshopper (Rhino 6) created for the purpose of generating custom documents, reports, articles, etc. that can be updated in real time. 

## How it works?

Pterodactyl sends data (saves it locally) as .md, which is Markdown filename extension. To open it or to save it as PDF or HTML, you need Typora, which is completely free, lightweight text editor. You can download it [here](https://typora.io/).

Basically it works like this:



```mermaid
graph LR
	subgraph Create, change and see updates of your document in real time
    A[Grasshopper with Pterodactyl] -->|.md file| B(Typora)
    end
    B -->D[.pdf]
    B -->E[.html]
```

You can try other Markdown editors, Typora is recommended.
